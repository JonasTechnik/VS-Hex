**How it works**

VSHex runs in the background and automatically detects when you copy a hex color code to your clipboard. Once it detects a hex color code, it converts it to a Visual Studio color code that can be used in your Forms or UserControls.

The converted color code is then automatically copied to your clipboard, making it easy for you to use it in your Visual Studio projects.
